/**
 * A plugin that changed has to say so in its version.
 *
 * While the plugin was assembled elsewhere and published here, the publisher
 * refused to change the contents of a version somebody had already installed.
 * Now that the plugin is written here, an edit is just a commit - so the rule
 * moves to the only place that can still see it, which is the diff.
 *
 * Without it the failure is quiet and permanent: a client that has 0.1.0
 * compares versions to decide whether an update exists, finds the same number,
 * and never fetches the fix. Nobody sees an error; the plugin is simply wrong
 * on every machine that already had it.
