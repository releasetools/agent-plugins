# Working in this repository

This is where the plugins live. Editing one is an ordinary pull request: change
the files under `plugins/<name>/`, bump its version, and the merge is the
release. Nothing is copied in from anywhere else.

Two files are generated and must not be hand-edited: the catalogs.

## What is here

```text
plugins/<name>/                   A plugin. The source, not a copy of one
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json   Claude Code's catalog     (generated)
.agents/plugins/marketplace.json  Codex's catalog           (generated)
scripts/validate-plugin.mjs       One plugin's own layout
scripts/validate-marketplaces.mjs What holds between the two catalogs
scripts/sync-catalogs.mjs         Writes both catalogs from plugins/
scripts/check-version-bump.mjs    A changed plugin has to say so in its version
scripts/install-agent-skills.mjs  For the agents that read no manifest
scripts/catalogs.mjs              What all of those agree on
__tests__/                        Jest, run by `npm test`
```

## The two catalogs

Both name the marketplace `releasetools`, so `mutex@releasetools` means the same
thing in either client. They describe the same plugins in the same order, and
each keeps its own client's schema:

- **Claude Code** takes a relative `source` of `./plugins/<name>`, the plugin's
  version, and the descriptive metadata it shows - description, author,
  homepage, licence, keywords. All of it comes from the plugin's
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
- **Codex** takes a local source object, `policy.installation: AVAILABLE`,
  `policy.authentication: ON_INSTALL`, and a category. It keeps its display
  metadata in the plugin's own manifest under `interface`, so the catalog entry
  carries only the category, which comes from there too.

Codex has no other kind of source. Its catalog resolves a plugin as a path
inside the marketplace it cloned, so a plugin cannot be a pointer at another
repository - which is why the plugins are here rather than referenced.

Neither client validates the other's file, so a marketplace whose two halves
disagree installs different things depending on which agent you asked. That is
what `validate-marketplaces.mjs` exists to catch, along with a source escaping
`plugins/`, a catalog version that is not the plugin's, a symlink or a secret in
a published tree, and a catalog somebody reformatted by hand.

## Changing a plugin

```shell
npm run check          # lint, typecheck, tests, then both validators
npm run sync           # rewrite the catalogs from plugins/
```

**Bump the version in both manifests.** This is the rule with no second chance:
a client that already installed 0.1.0 compares versions to decide whether an
update exists, so shipping a fix under the same number means nobody receives it,
quietly, on every machine that already had it. `check-version-bump.mjs` reads
the diff against the base branch and fails the pull request when a plugin
changed and its version did not.

Semver is judged from what an agent sees: new commands or skills are a minor,
wording and fixes are a patch, and removing a command or changing what one does
is a major.

## The plugin and the CLI it drives

`plugins/mutex/skills/mutex/agent-lock.mjs` wraps the `mutex` CLI. It knows that
CLI's exit codes, subcommands and flags, so the two move together even though
their versions do not: a renamed flag upstream is a broken plugin here. The
tests cover the helper against a stub, which is not the same as covering it
against the real thing - so treat a mutex release as a reason to check.

The `mutex` npm package carries a copy of `skills/` and `commands/`, fetched
from here when that release is built, so a global install can still seed Hermes,
Gemini and Antigravity - the agents that read no manifest and have no checkout.
`install-agent-skills.mjs` is what copies it, and it runs from either home.

## Before committing

```shell
npm run check
claude plugin validate --strict .
```

`.github/workflows/validate.yml` runs those, then installs every published
plugin with both clients out of the checkout. `main` requires the `validated`
job, which is one check name that stays true as the matrix grows.
